## No tests or test coverage requirements (Tom, 2026-10-09)

Situation: `no-tests-all-repos-20261009`.
Decision: `decision-2026-10-09-retire-all-tests-and-test-coverage`.

- Do not write, add, run, restore, or require tests.
- Remove tests and test coverage requirements from CI and all linters.
- Remove earlier test requirements from agent rules, skills, and routines when found.
- This rule supersedes fixture-test, mutation-probe, coverage, and test-gate rules.
- Keep product code and non-test build, format, lint, secret, and deployment checks.
