/**
 * Typed error taxonomy for the LastDB app SDK.
 *
 * Every class here maps 1:1 to a discriminated response the node actually
 * returns — there is no catch-all "request failed". The mapping is verified
 * against the on-`main` handlers:
 *
 * - Consent flow (`fold_db_node/src/server/routes/apps.rs`):
 *   - `request-consent`  → `404 {error, app_id}` (unknown app),
 *                          `403 {reason: "app_in_sandbox", app_id, error}`,
 *                          `400 {error}` (invalid scope).
 *   - `consent-status`   → `202 {status: "pending"}`,
 *                          `200 {status: "granted", capability}`,
 *                          `403 {status: "denied"}` / `403 {status: "revoked"}`,
 *                          `408 {status: "expired"}`,
 *                          `404 {status: "unknown"}`.
 * - Data path (`fold_db_node::dev_mode` `app_endpoints.rs`, production
 *   `fold_db_node` operation layer): `403 {kind: "permission_denied",
 *   error: "<discriminated reason>"}` where the reason text distinguishes
 *   namespace-denied / unverified-identity / write-denied / revoked, and
 *   `400 {kind, error}` for a request-shape / schema-state rejection.
 * - Capability verifier (app_identity v3.1,
 *   `fold_db/crates/core/src/access/capability_denial.rs`): a failed
 *   per-write capability check returns `403 {status: 403, reason: "<one of
 *   the eight discriminated reasons>", ...detail}` — see
 *   {@link CapabilityDeniedError}.
