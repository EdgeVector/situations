/**
 * `ownerClient` — the ergonomic entry point for OWNER / HOST-context apps.
 *
 * Some apps (fbrain, fsituations, and other first-party host tools) run in the
 * node OWNER's own context: they authenticate with an `X-User-Hash` identity
 * header only, never go through the consent/capability flow, and resolve their
 * OWN socket path from their config. For them the async {@link connect} does not
 * fit:
 *
 * - `connect` is async and auto-loads a stored capability from the default OS
 *   keychain — an owner-context app wants neither (no keychain touch, no async
 *   consent load);
 * - `ConnectOptions` accepts EITHER `baseUrl` OR `socketPath`, never a
 *   caller-resolved explicit socket path ALONGSIDE a loopback-gated `baseUrl`
 *   TCP fallback;
 * - `connect`'s `discoverSocket` reads only env + the default data-dir; it
 *   ignores an app-supplied config socket path.
 *
 * So today every owner-context app hand-builds the transport (`udsTransport` /
 * `httpTransport`) and calls the 6-arg `new LastDbClient(...)` positional
 * constructor with a no-op capability store. `ownerClient` collapses that
 * boilerplate into one synchronous, keychain-free factory.
