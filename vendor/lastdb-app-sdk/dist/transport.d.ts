 *    (brand-forward; SDK-preferred).
 * 2. `FOLDDB_SOCKET_PATH` — legacy socket-path alias (the current Rust client's

 * 4. `<data_dir>/folddb.sock` — the default the node binds, resolved via
 *    {@link resolveSocketPath} (honors the `LASTDB_HOME`/`FOLDDB_HOME` →
 *    `~/.lastdb`/`~/.folddb` home order).
 * 5. Loopback TCP at `fallbackBaseUrl` — the fallback when no socket exists.
 *
 * A socket path is only chosen when the file actually EXISTS, so a node that
 * binds no socket (a pre-data-plane node, or one whose bind failed)
 * transparently falls back to TCP. `defaultHeaders` are attached to whichever
 * transport is built (see {@link httpTransport}); a UDS caller does not need
 * the `X-User-Hash` identity header — the socket carries kernel peer
 * credentials — but passing it is harmless.
 *
 * On a non-Unix platform there is no UDS transport, so this always returns the
 * TCP transport (matching the Rust `#[cfg(not(unix))]` discovery).
